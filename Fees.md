# Maker Rebates Program

> Earn daily USDC rebates by providing liquidity on Polymarket

Polymarket has enabled taker fees on **all crypto markets**, **NCAAB (college basketball)**, and **Serie A** markets. These fees fund a **Maker Rebates** program that pays daily USDC rebates to liquidity providers.

***

## Why Maker Rebates

Sports markets benefit from the same dynamics as crypto markets. When liquidity is deeper:

* Spreads tend to be tighter
* Price impact is lower
* Fills are more reliable
* Markets are more resilient during volatility

Maker Rebates incentivize **consistent, competitive quoting** so everyone gets a better trading experience.

***

## How Maker Rebates Work

* **Paid daily in USDC:** Rebates are calculated and distributed every day.
* **Performance-based:** You earn based on the share of liquidity you provided that actually got taken.

### Eligibility

Place orders that add liquidity to the book and get filled (i.e., your liquidity is taken by another trader).

### Payment

Rebates are paid daily in USDC, directly to your wallet.

***

## Funding

Maker Rebates are funded by taker fees collected in eligible markets. A percentage of these fees are redistributed to makers who keep the markets liquid. The rebate percentage differs by market type.

| Market Type                  | Period        | Maker Rebate | Distribution Method |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| 15-Min Crypto                | Jan 19, 2026+ | 20%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| 5-Min Crypto                 | Feb 12, 2026+ | 20%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Sports (NCAAB, Serie A)      | Feb 18, 2026+ | 25%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| 1H, 4H, Daily, Weekly Crypto | Mar 6, 2026+  | 20%          | Fee-curve weighted  |

<Note>
  Polymarket collects taker fees in eligible markets (all crypto markets, NCAAB,
  and Serie A). The rebate percentage is at the sole discretion of Polymarket
  and may change over time.
</Note>

***

## Fee-Curve Weighted Rebates

Rebates are distributed using the **same formula as taker fees**. This ensures makers are rewarded proportionally to the fee value their liquidity generates.

For each filled maker order:

```text  theme={null}
fee_equivalent = C × p × feeRate × (p × (1 - p))^exponent
```

Where **C** = number of shares traded and **p** = price of the shares. The fee parameters differ by market type:

| Parameter | Sports (NCAAB, Serie A) | Crypto |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------ |
| Fee Rate  | 0.0175                  | 0.25   |
| Exponent  | 1                       | 2      |

Your daily rebate:

```text  theme={null}
rebate = (your_fee_equivalent / total_fee_equivalent) * rebate_pool
```

Totals are calculated per market, so you only compete with other makers in the same market.

***

## Taker Fee Structure

Taker fees are calculated in USDC and vary based on the share price. However, fees are collected in shares on buy orders and USDC on sell orders. Fees are highest at 50% probability and lowest at the extremes (near 0% or 100%).

### Fee Precision

Fees are rounded to 4 decimal places. The smallest fee charged is 0.0001 USDC. Anything smaller rounds to zero, so very small trades near the extremes may incur no fee at all.
